# TriangularArbitrageCryptos

Triangular arbitrage is an strategy that tries to exploit uncorrelations from 3 correlated markets.  
For example, BTC/USDT, ETH/BTC, ETH/USDT   
If the net worth is profitable after trading fees trades will be executed one after the other.  

This price mismatch is calculated from the pondered price to buy certain amount from the order book, not just from the high and low bids and asks.
Tested execution in binance and bitfinex.
